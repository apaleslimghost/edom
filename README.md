# Edom

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

An Adversary Mapper for [Night's Black Agents](http://pelgranepress.com) and other GUMSHOE-system games

In *Night's Black Agents*, mapping the connections between your adversaries gives you a team bonus.

It also helps you keep track of the story.

Edom lets you build and connect cards on the fly. We spin ours up using Heroku using a really clever secret sauce which, to be honest, I don't know how it works.

But, hey! You're a badass superspy or you wouldn't be here. I have every confidence in you.
